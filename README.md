# Predict_Employee_Turnover


## Introduction

Employee turnover, also known as employee attrition, is a critical challenge faced by organizations across industries. It refers to the rate at which employees leave a company and need to be replaced. High turnover can significantly impact a company's productivity, morale, and ultimately, its bottom line. Predicting employee turnover can help organizations proactively identify at-risk employees and take necessary actions to retain them.

In this project, we will leverage data science techniques and Python programming to build a predictive model for employee turnover. The dataset used for this analysis, named [HR_employee_data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmldas/hr-employee-data-descriptive-analytics?resource=download), was obtained from Kaggle and contains various features related to employees such as satisfaction level, number of projects, average monthly hours worked, time spent at the company, and whether they have had a work accident, among others.

By analyzing this dataset and applying machine learning algorithms, we aim to develop a model that can accurately predict which employees are likely to leave the company. This predictive capability can enable HR departments and organizational leaders to implement targeted retention strategies, improve employee satisfaction, and reduce turnover rates.

Through this project, we will demonstrate the power of data-driven insights in addressing complex business challenges and empowering organizations to make informed decisions to retain top talent and foster a productive work environment.
